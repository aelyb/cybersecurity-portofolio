# Competitor Mail V2 ‚Äì APK Analysis & Exploit Evaluation

This project was conducted as part of a mobile penetration testing final exam. The objective was to analyze and evaluate the security of a competitor‚Äôs Android mail application using static and dynamic techniques.

### üîç Scope of Assessment
- Rooted Device and Emulator Detection (bypass attempt)
- Message Duplication via Email Function
- SharedPreferences Data Exposure
- Intent Forgery via LocalBroadcastManager

### ‚úÖ Key Findings
