# Digital Forensics â€“ Hashing & File Integrity Lab

This lab investigates file integrity using MD5 hashes and hex-level file modification. Through hands-on tasks, the effect of altering file bytes on hash values was analyzed using tools like HashCalc and HxD.

Insights on the reliability of MD5 and the risks of steganography in image files are also included in the analysis.
